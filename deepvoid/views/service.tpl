            <h3 class="testimonial-title1">"TURNKEY" SERVICE</h3>
            <p class="testimonial-text1">
                The turnkey service means that we do everything ourselves and relieve you of any involvement in the process of organizing the technical part of the event. 
                All that is required from you is to place an order, sign a contract, and make an advance payment.
            </p>
            <p class="testimonial-text1">
                Most often, the turnkey service is used by Event companies, private organizers and all those who are used to trusting professionals. 
                If you are not strong in decibel calculations, do not know how to connect an amplifier to a mixer and simply do not have the skills to work with equipment, 
                the turnkey event technical support service is your option.

            <h3 class="testimonial-title1">"SELF-PICKUP" SERVICE</h3>
            <p class="testimonial-text1">
                The second option is pick-up from our warehouse. This option is used in 80% of cases by professionals in the field of sound and lighting equipment. 
                First of all,these are our colleagues in the shop - professional DJs, sound engineers and lighting operators. 
                They have a lot of experience in the Event field, so they know exactly what the difference is between a master fader and a potentiometer, and they know that a crossover is not always a type of car.
            </p>
            <p class="testimonial-text1">
                Since pick-up does not involve delivery and support by our employees, we do not issue expensive equipment or devices in large quantities.
